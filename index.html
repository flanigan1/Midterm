<p><strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">standard markup language</a> for creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">web pages</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application">web applications.</a> With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> <i>(CSS)</i>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript,</a> it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web.</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">Web browsers</a> receive HTML documents from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webserver">webserver</a> or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic">semantically</a> and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_element">HTML element</a> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldset">interactive forms</a>, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_document">structured documents</a> by denoting structural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics">
semantics</a> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">links</a>, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by <i>tags</i>, written using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracket#Angle_brackets">angle brackets</a>. Tags such as <strong>&lt img /&gt</strong> and <strong>&ltinput /&gt</strong> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as <strong>&lt p&gt...&lt/p&gt</strong> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<hr>
<h2><strong>Development</strong></h2>
<p >In 1980, physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, a contractor at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a>, proposed and prototyped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext system</a>. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert Cailliau </a> collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</p>

<p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGMLguid">SGMLguid</a>, an in-house <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language">Standard Generalized Markup Language</a> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.</p>

<p>HTML is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> that <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browsers</a> use to interpret and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting">compose text</a>, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS</a>. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF">RUNOFF command</a> developed in the early 1960s for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>
